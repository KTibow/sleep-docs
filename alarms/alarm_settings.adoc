//= Options

//Alarms can be setup in two places, because you need one default configuration controlling all alarms, and still an option for unique behavior of special alarms.

//== Default alarm settings
//Alarm default settings allow you to modify basic behaviour for all your alarms. Default settings are also applied to all new alarms.

//=== Smart wakeup
//[horizontal]
//Smart wake up:: See <</alarms/smart_wake_up#,Smart wake up>>

//=== Captcha
//[horizontal]
//Captcha:: See <</alarms/captcha#,Captcha>>

//=== Sound
//Sound:: See <</alarms/ringtone#,Sound>>.
//Gentle volume increase[[gentle_alarm]]:: Gentle volume makes sure to wake you with minimum volume required for a more pleasant wake up. Alarm starts at minimum volume and will gradually increase to maximum.
//* *Disabled* - Alarm rings at system's alarm stream volume (or media stream when using streaming services or changing the _Alarm output_ settings). For more details see the <</alarms/ringtone#,Ringtone>> section.
//* *30 seconds* - a brief period of increased sound followed by sound at current system's volume.
//* *1-24 minutes* - Sets how long it takes to reach the max volume; the longer the period, the slower the volume increases and the longer it takes to reach the max.

//NOTE: Please, test it before using it, on some devices the alarm output may be silenced due to DND or other settings, on other phones, the system still routes the media stream to both devices.

//[[per-alarm]]
//== Alarm-specific "per-alarm" settings
//Alarm-specific settings change behaviour of a particular alarm; those changes won't affect other alarms or default settings.

//NOTE: All default options are also available as alarm-specific options.


//There are also few options that are only available in alarm-specific settings:

//* *Non-weekly* - every 2nd-6th day
//* *Monday - Sunday* - you can choose any combination of weekdays.

You have a repeating alarm on We, Th and you set your Next alarm day to Monday next week. Next time the alarm will trigger is Wednesday next week.


=== How to changing the time of the next alarm
You can adjust time of next alarm just for a single execution of the alarm, with the (+) and (-) buttons.

- click the little downward arrow under “other calendars” on the left side of the default calendar view (beside “add”).
- click on “browse interesting calendars” and you should be able to see and subscribe to _Public holidays_.

Whenever your calendar event collides with your next active alarm, Sleep as Android will move that alarm to an earlier time.

How long before the event will the moved alarm ring? You can set that using the slider below this option.

If you want a specific calendar event to reschedule your alarm by a specific time (overriding the slider), you can do that by writing an expression in the following format in the _title_ or _description_ of the calendar event.

[horizontal]
#alarm-30::  Advances the alarm for 30 minutes
#alarm-30m:: Advances the alarm for 30 minutes

//== Disable repeating alarms on holidays
//*Allows skipping alarms from ringing on public holidays.*

//Whenever the app finds a public holiday in the calendar, you get a notification with an option to skip the alarm.

//[NOTE]
//====
//Most users should have already subscribed public holidays to their calendar. If this is not your case, do this:

//- click the little downward arrow under “other calendars” on the left side of the default calendar view (beside “add”).
//- click on “browse interesting calendars” and you should be able to see and subscribe to _Public holidays_.

//== Reschedule alarms based on Google Calendar
//Whenever your calendar event collides with your next active alarm, Sleep as Android will move that alarm to an earlier time.

//How long before the event will the moved alarm ring? You can set that using the slider below this option.

//If you want a specific calendar event to reschedule your alarm by a specific time (overriding the slider), you can do that by writing an expression in the following format in the _title_ or _description_ of the calendar event.

//Examples:

/- #alarm-30  (advances the alarm for 30 minutes)
/- #alarm-30m (advances the alarm for 30 minutes)
/- #alarm+20 (postpones the alarm for 20 minutes)
/- #alarm+20h (postpones the alarm for 20 hours)
/- #alarm-1h (advances the alarm for 1 hour)
/- #alarm+2h30m (postpones the alarm for 2 hours 30 min)
/- #alarm+2h30 (postpones the alarm for 2 hours 30 min)
/- #alarm+2:15 (postpones the alarm for 2 hours 15 min)

//You will always get a notification whenever any of your alarms is going to be rescheduled, with an option to revert that.

//== Create an alarm only as vibrations on watch (no sound)

//. Set the alarm silent (_<<per-alarm,Alarm-specific settings>> -> Sound -> Silent_) or set the delay on sound (_Settings -> Alarms -> Delayed alarm sound start_).
//. Enable wearable vibrations (_Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Alarm_).
//+
//NOTE: We highly recommend to set a sound delay instead of setting the alarm silent, especially when backup alarm is silent too.


//== Create silent alarm

//. Set the alarm silent (_<<per-alarm,Alarm-specific settings>> -> Sound -> Silent_).
//. This option is available only in <<per-alarm,Alarm-specific settings>>, not in _Settings -> Alarms_. This is a safety measure to prevent unintentional silent alarms.
//+
//NOTE: We highly recommend to set a sound delay instead of setting the alarm silent, especially when backup alarm is silent too.

//== Use my own sound as alarm
//. Open Ringtone selection: _Settings -> Alarm default settings -> Sound_ or _<<per-alarm,Alarm-specific settings>> -> Sound_.
//. Tap on folder icon:ic_folder[] icon in right upper corner.
//. Choose a sound file saved on your phone.
//+
//NOTE: In the file picker you may first need to enable showing of external storage to be able to see your sound there.


//== Dismiss alarm before alarm time

//. Open before alarm notification (appears one hour before alarm) from the notification bar on your phone. On newer phones, you need to expand the notification with the expanding arrow.
//. Dismiss from the notification.
