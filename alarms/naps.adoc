*Schedule an alarm to trigger _after_ a certain amount of time rather than _at_ a certain hour and minute.*

[EXAMPLE]
Instead of scheduling the alarm for e.g. 7 AM, you can schedule an alarm to ring in 15 minutes from now.

Add new a alarm using _icon:ic_alarm_plus[] -> Nap button_. You can select naps from 1 minute to 10 hours.
