== How to set up tracking with a wearable

. First of all, make sure your wearable is supported (see the <<supported_wearables, table>>)
. Install the required companion apps (this depends on the wearable type, check the <<supported_wearables, table>>) for more details).
. Select the corresponding option in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable_.

NOTE: Sleep tracking collects data the whole night and they are analyzed in real-time. This means the watch must stay connected with BT during sleep tracking.

== Supported wearables[[supported_wearables]]

Sleep as Android supports a wide variety of smartwatches. Take a look at the list:
