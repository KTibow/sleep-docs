== How to set up tracking with a wearable

. First of all, make sure your wearable is supported (see the <<supported_wearables, table below>>).
. Check if the wearable is connected properly via Bluetooth.
. Install the required companion apps - this depends on the wearable type, check the <<supported_wearables, table below>>, or one of the subpages.
. Select the corresponding option in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable_.
. You can test the connection on some wearables with the Test sensor - see <</devices/test_sensor, details about testing the connection here>>.

You can find specific guides for each wearable type on the subpages of the Wearable section.

NOTE: Sleep tracking collects data the whole night and the data are analyzed in real-time. This means the watch must stay connected with BT during sleep tracking.

== Supported wearables[[supported_wearables]]

Sleep as Android supports a wide variety of smartwatches. Take a look at the list:

.Legend for sensors

[horizontal]
‚Üù:: Movement detected from the wearables' accelerometer
‚ù§:: Heart rate (HR)
üíü:: Heart rate variability (HRV) - all models from the category with this sensor
‚óå:: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) - all models from the category with this sensor

== Guide

=== Create an alarm only as vibrations on watch (no sound, delayed sound)

. Set the alarm silent (_<<per-alarm,Alarm-specific settings>> -> Ringtone -> Silent_) or set the delay on sound (_Settings -> Alarms -> Sound delay_).
. Enable wearable vibrations (_Settings -> Wearables -> Vibrate_).
+
NOTE: We highly recommend to set a sound delay instead of setting the alarm silent, especially when backup alarm is silent too.
