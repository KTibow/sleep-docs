Sleep as Android supports a wide variety of smartwatches. Take a look at the list:

== Supported wearables[[supported_wearables]]

|===
|Manufacturer |Device |Supported sensors |Notes


{% for wearable in site.data.wearables %}
  {% if wearable['Support /<br>sensors'] contains 'YES' %}

| +++ {{ wearable.Vendor }} +++
| +++ {{ wearable.Device }} +++
| +++ {{ wearable['Sensors supported'] }} +++
| +++ {{ wearable['Notes'] }} +++

  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

== How to set up tracking with a wearable

. First of all, make sure your wearable is supported (see the <<supported_wearables, table>>)
. Install the required companion apps (this depends on the wearable type, check the <<supported_wearables, table>>) for more details).
. Select the corresponding option in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable_.
