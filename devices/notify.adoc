Sleep as Android can be used for sleep tracking with several Amazfit wearables, and Mi Bands. As the API for direct integration is not open, you need to install the companion app. This chapter targets https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mc.miband1[Notify for MiBand] and https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mc.amazfit1[Notify for Amazfit & Zepp] users. These apps are developed by mailto:mat90c@gmail.com[Matteo].

With Amazfits and MiBands, you can monitor your movement and HR values.

. Make sure the watch is connected to the phone and to the Notify app
. Ënable the connection in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable -> XiaoMi MiBand (Notify for MiBand) / Huami Amazfit (Notify for Amazfit & Zepp)_.
. Test the connection in Settings -> Wearables -> Test sensor - you should see a graph reacting to your movement (a short delay is normal, data are sent in batches).

When the Mi Band is in *Sleep Assistant* HR mode in Mi Fit, it doesn’t feed the HR data to Mi Band Tools / Sleep as Android. When it is in regular HR tracking mode (24-hour), it works.
