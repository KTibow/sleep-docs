=== How to setup sunrise alarm (sunrise-like wakeup) ?

. Enable _Settings -> Smartlight -> Use smartlight_
. Select your smartlight:
* Use phone's screen as a smartlight: Enable _Smartlight -> Use screen light_
* Use a smartbulb as a smartlight: Connect using _Smartlight -> Philips HUE, IKEA Tr책dfri (disconnected)_
* Use Sleep Phaser as a smartlight: Connect using _Smartlight -> Sleep Phaser (disconnected)_ and enable _Smartlight_ right under it.
* Use cable-type Sleep Mask as a smartlight: Connect using _Smartlight -> Use Sleep Mask_.

After you've done the above steps to connect and enable the smartlight of your choice, all of your alarms will turn on the smartlight when they start ringing. Now, to have a truly sunrise wakeup, you probably want the smartlight to turn on _before_ the alarm rings.

To set that up, head to _Settings -> Alarms -> Alarm sound start_ and set it to some period. At the time of the alarm, only the smartlight will turn on at the lowest brightness and gradually brighten up until the set period passes. Then the alarm starts ringing.

Without the delayed sound start, you can control the speed of sun-rise effect by changing the period of <</alarm/alarm_settings/gentle_alarm#,Gentle volume increase>>. The longer the period is, the longer it takes to get from dark to full light.
