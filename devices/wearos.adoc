Sleep tracking with Wear OS device requires a companion app installed from the Play Store on the watch.
All Wear OS devices can monitor sleep tracking movement and collect HR. Some wearables can also collect SpO2 data - for more details, please see the chapter on <</devices/oximeter#, oximeters and SpO data>>.

== How to set up

. Make sure the watch is connected to the phone.
. Go to app list on your watch, select Play Store.
. Find *Sleep as Android* and select _Install_.
. After the companion app is installed, you can enable the connection in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable -> Wear OS_.
. Test the connection in Settings -> Wearables -> Test sensor - you should see a graph reacting to your movement (a short delay is normal, data are sent in batches).
. For HR data, enable *Heart rate monitoring* in _Settings -> Wearables_.
