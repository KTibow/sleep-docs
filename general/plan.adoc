We offer two intertwined apps - Sleep as Android and SleepCloud. Both have free and premium versions.

== FREE Sleep as Android

With free version of Sleep as Android, you get 14 day trial of full working app to test all its features and functionality. After the trial expires, you can still use the app for free, but sleep tracking features are limited to every other day (tracking is limited for tracking started on Tuesday and Thursday). All non-tracking features work without limits.
In addition, the free app shows advertisements.

== FULL Sleep as Android

The full version with unlimited sleep tracking is paid since we are putting considerable amounts of work into the app and it is our main source of income.

There are thee options to get full Sleep as Android:
1. Unlock stand-alone app
2. In-app lifetime Sleep
3. Subscription for Sleep

=== Unlock stand-alone app

You can upgrade the app to full version by purchasing the stand-alone https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.full.key[Sleep as Android Unlock app on Play Store]. The Unlock app is just a holder of the license, it is installed on top of Sleep as Android so that all your settings and data stay as they are.

_Pros_
- Purchase recognition never fails. The Unlock app serves as an anchor for the purchase recognition, so as long as you keep the Unlock app  installed, you will have full version.
- Eligible for sharing via https://support.google.com/families/answer/7007852?hl=en[Google Family Library].

_Cons_
- You need to install an additional app nad keep it on the phone all the time.


=== In-app lifetime Sleep as Android

Full app purchased on Play Store via a link from the app is called "in-app".

_Pros_
- You don’t download a separate app

_Cons_
- You need internet connection to verify your purchase (but this doesn't happen too often and there’s a lot of caching involved)
- If you are using multiple Google accounts, make sure the account you used to purchase the app is always the primary account in the Play Store app, otherwise Sleep as Android may start acting as free version.

=== Subscription for Sleep as Android

Subscription is mainly for users, who are not yet decided if they would benefit from the lifetime purchase.
The fee is monthly.
The subscription type includes SleepCloud PRO version.

== FREE SleepCloud

With free version of SleepCloud, you can do backups only once a week. The online account is available without any limits.

== FULL SleepCloud

The full version with unlimited backups is paid since we have to pay for the cloud storage to Google (whose servers we are using). The fee is charged yearly.
Full SleepCloud version is already included in the monthly subscription plan.
