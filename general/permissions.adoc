Sleep as Android has a lot of functionality, some of which can be only enabled with permissions granted by user. See below on usage details for each permission.

|Location [[location]]

- Bluetooth-connected devices, such as <</devices/wearables#,wearables>>

a|We use approximate location (network-based) to implement some of the cool location based features. We gather the location data and make them more coarse to +/- 5 km.

For all of this, we would be okay with _approximate location_ permission. However for _bluetooth connecting_ and _pair tracking_ features, we have to also ask for _precise location_.

You can completely opt-out from location storing in _Settings -> Miscellaneous_.
