You have probably activated uninstall protection in CAPTCHA Cheatin prevention.

This option registers the app as a device administrator in order to block turning off the phone when an alarm rings.

- Go to _System settings -> Location and Security -> Device Administrator_ and deselect the admin which you want to uninstall.
- or disable *Force stop and uninstall protection* in _Settings -> Captcha: Stop oversleeping! -> Captcha Cheatin protection_ (might be hidden under Advanced menu)

Now uninstall the application. If it still says you need to deactivate the application before uninstalling, you may need to Force Stop the application before uninstalling.g
