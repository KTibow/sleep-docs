You have probably activated Prevent escaping CAPTCHA option.

This option registers the app as a device administrator in order to block turning off the phone when an alarm rings.


- Go to _System settings -> Location and Security -> Device Administrator_ and deselect the admin which you want to uninstall.
- or disable *Prevent escaping Captcha* in _Settings -> Captcha: Stop oversleeping! -> Prevent escaping Captcha_ (might be hidden under Advanced menu)

Now uninstall the application. If it still says you need to deactivate the application before uninstalling, you may need to Force Stop the application before uninstalling.
