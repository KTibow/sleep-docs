If you delete the graph from the Sleep app and it comes back later, check if the graph has icon:ic_cloud_upload[] icon. Those graphs are synced from external service - either Samsung Health of Google Fit.

If you delete the graphs there too, the they won't re-appear in the Sleep when you delete them.
