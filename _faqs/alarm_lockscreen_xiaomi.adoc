.Generally all new Android versions

Google made it impossible to start screens from the background on newer Android versions. This is why we can no longer show the alarm screen with the big buttons under usual settings. The app can just show notifications from the background if the screen is on when the alarm starts. If the screen is locked we usually are able to show the full-screen alarm.

. Go to _Settings -> Alarms -> Always fullscreen alarm_ (might be hidden under Advanced in Snooze/Dismiss section), and enable this option.
. It will take you to the system settings, where you need to grant the *Draw over other apps* permission.


.XiaoMi / MIUI
On Xiaomi/MIUI, you need to grant special permission to Sleep as Android so that it may unlock your screen during alarm.

. Go to _System Settings -> Permissions -> Advanced Permissions ->_ select Sleep app and give it permission to access Lockscreen.


NOTE: If you are using a Captcha task from the Captcha add-on, please, make sure the permission is granted to the add-on as well.


.Samsung
When alarm goes off, it does not disable the lockscreen and you have to manually unlock the device to tap snooze or dismiss.

You may have Sleep as Android enabled under Border lights. This causes the alarm popup to not display over the lockscreen, as the notification is being shown as a light around the edge of the screen.

. Disable Border lights for Sleep as Android in your deviceâ€™s settings.
