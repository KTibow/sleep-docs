The purchase process is done by Google and is completely out of our control. But from other usersâ€™ experience any duplicate charges have always been refunded after a while automatically by the Google payment system. You can check if this has already happened in your Google Wallet account.

Please let us know at urbandroid.info@gmail.com if no refund is made for several days.
