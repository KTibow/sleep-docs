Please check our <</devices/wearables#,integration table>> table – only devices with a heart icon will measure heart rate with Sleep as Android. Other smartwatches with HR sensor need to go around SaA – save HR to S Health or Google Fit, from where Sleep as Android will download it. Please note that Sleep as Android downloads the measurements usually with a day’s delay (the sync is triggered once another record is saved).

.BT Smart device
. Please make sure you did enabled _Settings -> Wearables -> Bluetooth Smart
. Try to pair with your device (this may not be required for all devices and OS versions)
. Make sure no other app is using your device while sleep tracking.

.MiBands
Check your HR settings in the Mi Fit app.
When the Mi Band is in *Sleep Assistant* HR mode in Mi Fit, it doesn’t feed the HR data to Mi Band Tools / Sleep as Android. When it is in regular HR tracking mode (24-hour), it works.
