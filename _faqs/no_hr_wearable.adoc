Please check our <</devices/wearables#,integration table>> table – only devices with a heart icon will measure heart rate with Sleep as Android. Other smartwatches with HR sensor need to go around SaA – save HR to S Health or Google Fit, from where Sleep as Android will download it. Please note that Sleep as Android downloads the measurements usually with a day’s delay (the sync is triggered once another record is saved).

For enabling heart rate monitoring with compatible wearables, go to _Settings -> Wearables > Heart rate monitoring_.
For enabling heart rate monitoring with BT smart device, go to _Settings -> Wearables -> Bluetooth Smart_.

.BT Smart device
. Try to pair with your device (this may not be required for all devices and OS versions).
. Make sure no other app is using your device while sleep tracking...

.MiBands
Check your HR settings in the Mi Fit app.
When the Mi Band is in *Sleep Assistant* HR mode in Mi Fit, it doesn’t feed the HR data to Mi Band Tools / Sleep as Android. When it is in regular HR tracking mode (24-hour), it works.

- *Tools&MiBand* - Check if _Heart Rate Monitor_ is enabled in T&MB _Left_ ☰ _menu -> Heart Rate_ -> icon:ic_cog[] -> _Heart Rate monitor_
- *Notify&Fitness* - Enable heart rate monitoring in N&F icon:ic_action_graph[] -> _Sleep -> Monitor heart_, and also in N&F icon:ic_action_graph[] -> _Sleep -> More options -> Sleep as Android -> Settings -> Heart monitor_

.Wear OS
- For older versions of Android (4 and lower) on your phone, you need to opt-in to our <</faq/get_beta#, Beta testing channel>>. Newer version no longer needs to be in Beta.
