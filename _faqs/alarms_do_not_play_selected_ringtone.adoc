Loading of the selected file may have failed::
. Make sure that you have selected the correct ringtone - check link:/docs/alarms/alarm_settings.html#per-alarm[per-alarm settings] and Alarm default settings.
. Check if the file has not been moved or deleted and that SD card is available at the time of the alarm.
. Check that the app has storage permission to access that file.

Online service (Spotify, Google Music, online radio) may not have responded:: When the service is not responding for too long, the app uses a build-in ringtone.
Unfortunately due to Spotify API scheme, it is not possible to play any Spotify playlist from a 3rd party app such as Sleep as Android. We can only play one of your saved albums.
