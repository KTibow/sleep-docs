Loading of the selected file has failed.

* Re-select the ringtone and make sure the app has permission to external storage

Online Service (Spotify, Google Music, online radio) has not responded.

* When the service is not responding for too long, the app uses a build-in ringtone.
Unfortunately due to Spotify API scheme, it is not possible to play any Spotify playlist from a 3rd party app such as Sleep as Android. We can only play one of your saved albums.
