Loading of the selected file may have failed::
. Make sure that you have selected the correct ringtone - check <</alarms/alarm_settings#per-alarm,per-alarm settings>> and Alarm default settings.
. Check if the file has not been moved or deleted and that SD card is available at the time of the alarm.
. Check that the app has storage permission to access that file.

Online service (Spotify, Google Music, online radio) may not have responded:: When the service is not responding for too long, the app uses a build-in ringtone.
When alarm starts and your phone is locked we are unable to change the playlist or album in your Spotify app. In this case the app will play simply where you last left it.
