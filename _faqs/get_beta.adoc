We are rolling out the latest features first to beta testers to keep a good experience for regular users who are not so keen on new features but prefer everything as stable as possible.

. Please first join our BETA Testers group at:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sleep-as-an-droid
. That you can opt-into the BETA at the following address:
https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.urbandroid.sleep
or simply by visiting our Play Store listing and tapping "Join BETA"

NOTE: Without joining the Tester group, you cannot opt-in!

After that you should be starting receiving latest BETA updates through the Play Store.
