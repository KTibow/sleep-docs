title: Manual backup - cannot import data on my new phone

If you moved a `sleep-export.csv` file to your new phone and did not import the file before the app created a new sleep record, the app has replaced your `sleep-export.csv`. The old `sleep-export.csv` file was renamed to `sleep-export.backup.csv`.

To restore the old data:

. Delete the `sleep-export.csv` file.
. Rename `sleep-export.backup.csv` to `sleep-export.csv`.

In Sleep, do _Left menu > icon:ic_cloud_upload[]  Backup > Import data_.
