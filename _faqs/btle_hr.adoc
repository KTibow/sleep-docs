. Enable the tracking in _Settings -> Wearables ->Bluetooth Smart_ (might be hidden under Advanced section).
. Try to pair with your device (this may not be required for all devices and OS versions).
. Make sure no other app is using your device while sleep tracking.

NOTE: BT Smart heart rate tracking only works from Android 4.3 onward
