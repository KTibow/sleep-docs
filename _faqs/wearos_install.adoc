Sleep tracking with Wear OS device requires a companion app installed from the Play Store on the watch.

How to get there:

. Make sure the watch is connected to the phone.
. Go to app list on your watch, select Play Store.
. Find *Sleep as Android* and select _Install_.
. After the companion app is installed, you can enable the connection in _Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearable -> Wear OS_.
. Test the connection in Settings -> Wearables -> Test sensor - you should see a graph reacting to your movement (a short delay is normal, data are sent in batches).

NOTE: Sleep tracking collects data the night and they are analyzed in real-time. This means the watch must stay connected with BT during sleep tracking.
