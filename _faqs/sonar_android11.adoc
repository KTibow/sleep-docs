If you get completely flat graphs with automatic tracking with sonar sensor after upgrading to Android 11, make sure the app has permission *Draw over other apps*, *Display over other apps* or *Appear on top* (Samsung).
This permission is necessary for accessing the microphone from the background.

. _System settings -> Apps -> Sleep -> Appear on top_ / _Display over other apps_
. _System settings -> Apps -> More options (⁝) > Special access > Appear
on top_ / _Display over other apps_
