Battery optimization was enabled::
- When battery optimization is enabled, vibrations do not work, so the app is loading the built-in ringtone to ensure your wake up.
. Check _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Battery optimized_.
. Do not enable *Save battery* option from the _Tracking screen -> Stop and save pull up menu -> Save battery_.

Phone was rebooted::
- When the phone screen is locked after a reboot, the app cannot load any files.
- The phone rings with the build-in ringtone and vibrates.
