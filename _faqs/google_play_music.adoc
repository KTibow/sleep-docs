WARNING: Online Google Play Music is not supported. We only support playlists of locally available music created by Google Play Music.

Sleep will only see playlists:

- that are created from local music

Sleep will NOT see playlists:

- that are created in Play Music web app (https://play.google.com/music/) and downloaded via Play Music
- that are created from music that was downloaded via Play Music app (using the download button inside Play Music)

The reason is that we actually do not support Google Play Music at all. We support Android Playlist API which is supported by Play Music and other media player apps – they can register a list of songs as a playlist (locally on the phone), and then we see this playlist.
However Play Music in fact has another internal way of creating playlists, which is somehow different and not transparent to us, and we are unable to read these playlists.​
That’s why when selecting the playlist in Sleep as Android, sometimes you hear the playlist and sometimes not.
