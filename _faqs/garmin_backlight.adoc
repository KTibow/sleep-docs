On Garmin watches there is a system-wide _gesture backlight_ setting that will light up your screen on wrist move, when you have any app running. This setting is ON by default.
Go to *settings/system/lightning/during activity/gesture* and switch it to off. Now the light does not switch on if you are running or cycling and turning your wrist. Check that it's still on for buttons and alarms so it'll turn on if you need it during sport.

Fenix 6: It may be possible to set a power mode / power profile in the Power manager so that backlight won't light up in the Sleep app only.
