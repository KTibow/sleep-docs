If your volume gradually lowers after a while, when the tracking is running, the option *Turn off when sleeping* is enabled. This feature lowers the system-wide volume, so it affects even music played outside Sleep.

. Go to _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Lullabies -> Turn off when sleeping_.
. Extend the minimal playback time (5-90 min).
. Or disable the feature completely by setting it to *Use current device volume*.
