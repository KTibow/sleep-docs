There can be several reasons why your graphs are flat.

.The actigraphy is almost flat
When you can see some movement on the actigraphy, but the graph is unusually flat:
. *Sonar* - make sure the signal is strong enough by keeping sonar volume at max at _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Test sensor -> blue sliding bar_.
- you can also try different frequency by choosing other frequency from the ddrop down menu list in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Test sensor -> Frequency_
- keep the phone closer to you bed
- try different positioning of the phone
. *Accelerometer* - try keeping the phone closer to you.

.The actigraphy is flat, or red
