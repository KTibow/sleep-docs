Unfortunately our Spotify integration is all reverse engineered and thus may stop working any time Spotify updates their app.

NOTE: When alarm starts and your phone is locked we are unable to change the playlist or album in your Spotify app. In this case the app will play simply where you last left it. We have not found a fix for this yet.
