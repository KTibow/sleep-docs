title: Garmin - Cannot accept start dialog (green tick)

This dialog is the only way to start a watch app from the phone. There's unfortunately no way to do it without that dialog.

However, there is a bug in Garmin firmware that breaks this dialog on Vivoactive watches.

In that case please don't start sleep tracking from the phone.
As a workaround, start sleep tracking from the watch (just start the app on watch and it will trigger sleep tracking on the phone).
