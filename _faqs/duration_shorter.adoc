​The Sleep Duration is total sum of all your sleep phases (Light, REM, and Deep), not counting the awake phases - because when awake, you are actually not sleeping.
​So on default settings, the Sleep duration is always a bit shorter than the duration of tracking.

​If you wish your Sleep duration is the same as tracking duration:

* Disable the awake detection in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Awake detection_.
* You can also try to adjust the sensitivity of each type of settings to get optimal results. In most cases, too much awake periods are caused by significant HR peaks.
* If you are not sure, where those awake periods come from, please use _Left_ ☰ menu -> icon:ic_help_q[] Support ->icon:ic_bug[] Report a bug, and send us the application log.
