- Smart alarm is enabled (see <</alarms/smart_wake_up#,Smart wake up>>), so the app is waking you within the smart period, when light sleep is estimated.
- If that is not what you expect, disable smart period in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Smart period_.
- You can also try different smart period: shortest period is 5 minutes, longest is 2 hours.
