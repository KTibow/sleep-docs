Sleep as Android is not officially supported on Blackberry. However, a lot of users have reported running it without any hassle.

Often an issue is when you try to unlock Sleep as Android. You won’t be able to install the “Sleep as Android Unlock” app from the Play Store. A working solution is to buy the unlock and then send us a proof of purchase and application log (use _Left_ ☰ menu -> icon:ic_bug[] Report a bug). We’ll unlock the app specifically for your phone.
