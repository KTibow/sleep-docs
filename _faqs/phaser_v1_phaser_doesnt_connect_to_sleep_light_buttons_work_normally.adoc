In this case we suspect that bluetooth got into some weird state (bluetooth devices often do). Please do a systematical restart of all included devices:

. End sleep tracking, force close Sleep as Android.
. Disable/enable bluetooth.
. Start Sleep as Android.
. Plug the Phaser out and back in.
. Start sleep tracking.

If it doesn’t start working, then

. Restart your phone.
. Plug the Phaser out and back in.
. Disable/enable bluetooth.
. Start Sleep as Android.
. Start sleep tracking.

And ideally send us a debug log (**menu > report a bug**) afterwards.
