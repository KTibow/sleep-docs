In this case, we suspect that Bluetooth got into some weird state (Bluetooth devices often do). Please do a systematical restart of all included devices:

.	End sleep tracking, force close Sleep as Android.
.	Disable/enable Bluetooth.
.	Start Sleep as Android.
.	Plug the Phaser out and back in.
.	Start sleep tracking.

If it doesn’t start working, then

.	Restart your phone.
.	Plug the Phaser out and back in.
.	Disable/enable Bluetooth.
.	Start Sleep as Android.
.	Start sleep tracking.
