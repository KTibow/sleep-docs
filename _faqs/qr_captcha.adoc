. If there is an issue with Google's vision API, the scanner might not recognize the QR code.
. Try to use another QR scanner - e.g. Barcode Scanner and Google Goggles are supported.
. Clear the preferred app for QR scanning in _System settings -> Apps -> Sleep -> Clear defaults_.
. On newer phones clear the preferred app in _System settings -> Apps&Notifications ->  Sleep -> Open by default_.
