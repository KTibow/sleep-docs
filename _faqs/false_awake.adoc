- When there is too much awakes falsely estimated on your graph, use _Left_ â˜° _menu -> Report a bug, and send us the application log.
- Most often the awakes are driven by significant HR peaks (awakes align with HR red line graph), you can try disable this type of awake detection in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Awake detection -> Heart rate monitoring_.
- Other common reason is phone screen turned on, you can try to disblae Awake when using phone awake detection in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Awake detection -> Awake when using phone_.
