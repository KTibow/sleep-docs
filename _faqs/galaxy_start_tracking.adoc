This can be a result of multiple things, so please make sure to do the following troubleshooting:

. Make sure you have Sleep as https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.addon.generic.samsung[Android Gear Addon] installed on your phone
. It can happen that the addon cannot be started by us if it was force stopped previously. In that case please go to Play Store app on your phone, open https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.addon.generic.samsung[addon page] tap on “OPEN”.
. Opt out of any battery savers that you might have on your phone, for all involved apps (Sleep as Android, Sleep as Android Gear Addon, Samsung Accessory Services) – to find out how to do that, please consult dontkillmyapp.com
. Samsung Accessory services sometimes misbehaves and prevents connection to the watch for 3rd party apps. Please uninstall and reinstall it.
