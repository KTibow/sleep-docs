First, a good thing to have is *auto-delete*, which will delete your noises automatically after one week. This is enabled by default in _Settings -> Noise recording -> Automatic delete_ (might be hidden under Advanced section).

. Go to the _Left_ â˜° _menu -> icon:ic_action_noise[] Noise
. Long press on one of the recording and use *Delete all unstarred recordings*.

Also if you are getting too many noises from the night, you may consider a higher recording threshold in _Settings -> Noise recording -> Recording volume threshold_.
