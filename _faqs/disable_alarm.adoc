You can disable an alarm before the alarm time, if you wake up naturally before the alarm rings.

. *From notification* - 1 hour before alarm time, the "Before alarm notification" appears in your notification bar; expand the notification and choose "Dismiss".

. *From the tracking graph* - if you terminate the tracking, you can dismiss the alarm directly form the resulting graph.

. *From main screen* - long press on the alarm card, and select "Skip next".
