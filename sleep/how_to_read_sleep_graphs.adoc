== What it is
*Sleep graph is the <</sleep/sleep_tracking_theory#sleep-outcome,main outcome of sleep tracking>> - it shows analysed data from all the <</sleep/sensors#,sensors>> that were used during the night.*

== Sleep graph screen
The graph screen shows up to three graphs:

- <<actigraph,Actigraph>>: your activity or movement during sleep
- <<hypnogram,Hypnogram>>: your sleep phases
- <<noise-graph,Noise graph>>: ambient noise level (when <</sleep/sleep_noise_recording#,noise recording>> is enabled).

Graph screen also shows <<statistics,statistics>> about your night, along with an option to rate and annotate the record.

The app uses Actigraphy – activity-based sleep tracking – as the method of estimating your sleep phases. We have shown in a study that our approach produces a very good match with Polysonography – the de-facto golder standard for clinical sleep tracking with a fraction of the costs. See link:https://sleep.urbandroid.org/sleep-lab-comparison/[How does Sleep as Android compare to the sleeplab].

=== Statistics

a|
.Sleep record statistics
image::numbers.png[]
a|*Sleep record end date*:: <</faqs/why_sleep_counts_for_the_end_date#, Why end and not start?>>
*Deep sleep*::
- Top value (%) shows deep sleep ratio (how big a portion of the night did you spend in deep sleep).
- Bottom value (hours:minutes) shows deep sleep duration.
*Duration*::
- Top value (hours:minutes) shows sleep duration (sum of all sleep phases, awakes are not counted).
- Bottom value shows the [color-green]#surplus# or [color-red]#deficit# compared to your <</sleep/ideal_daily_sleep,Ideal daily sleep income>>.
*Snoring*::
- Top value (%) shows snoring ratio (how big a portion of the night did you spend snoring).
- Bottom value (hours:minutes) shows snoring duration.

=== Actigraph

[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|.Actigraph
image::acti.png[]
a|*Actigraph* shows the intensity of your nightly movements. The higher the peak, the more you’ve been moving.
|===

=== Hypnogram

[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|.Hypnogram
image::phase.png[]
a|*The hypnogram* shows your <</sleep/sleep_tracking_theory#,sleep phases>> progress during the night, estimated from actigraphic data and other inputs (e.g. awake periods).

- *Awake*: light green, the highest column reaching the top of the graph.
- *REM phase and light sleep*: shown as medium green, REM has lower columns.
- *Deep sleep*: shown as the lowest, dark green column.

[cols="1,2"]

a|.Red sections
image::red.png[]

a|Red sections on your graph indicate that the app did not receive data from sensors at that time. This usually happens when using wearables due to lost connection to the wearable. The phone's accelerometer can also (very rarely) malfunction.
|===

=== Noise graph

[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|.Noise graph
image::snore.png[]
a|*The noise graph* shows how much noise (sleep talk, snoring, environmental) was there throughout the night.

When <</sleep/sound_recognition#,sound recognition>> is enabled, sounds (cry, laugh, sneeze or cough, snoring and talking) are marked with <<markers-and-icons,icons>>.

=== Colored lines

[cols="1,2"]

a|.Oxygen level (Oximeter) + heart rate
image::hrbr.png[]

.Light level + heart rate
image::light.png[]

.Breath rate (sonar)
image::sonar_breath_rate.png[]

a|- *Blue line* = blood oxygen level if you are using oximeter. Blue dots with numbers indicate maximum and minimum (read more about <</sleep/breath_rate#,breath rate monitoring>>)
- *Red line* = heart rate through the night. Red dots with numbers inside are the maximum and minimum heart rate (read more about <</sleep/heart_rate#,heart rate monitoring>>).
- *Orange line* = light in your room in LUX units (read more about <</sleep/light_level#,light awake detection>>).
- *Turquoise (Blue-green) line* = breath rate if you are using sonar Blue dots with numbers indicate maximum and minimum (read more about <</sleep/breath_rate#,breath rate monitoring>>).
- *Dashed line* = smart period prior to alarm time (read more about <</alarms/smart_wake_up#,Smart wake up>>).

=== Markers and Icons
Besides deep sleep, REM phase and light sleep, there are several other events depicted in the sleep graphs.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|Icons on Actigraph
a|icon:ic_action_pause[] Tracking paused
icon:ic_alarm_time[] Alarm / snoozed alarm
icon:ic_action_sunrise[] Sunrise / sunset
icon:ic_action_noise[] Snoring event
icon:ic_action_cpap[] Low breath rate detected (Apnea event)
icon:ic_battery_60[] Low battery (switching to stand-by mode)
|===

[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|Icons on Noise graph
a|icon:ic_action_talk[] Sleep talking
icon:ic_action_sick[] Cough and sneeze
icon:ic_action_baby[] Baby cry
icon:ic_action_laugh[]Laugh
icon:ic_action_mic[] Sleep noise recorded
icon:ic_action_dream[] Lucid dreaming

== Guide

=== Editing graphs
For a guide on how to edit a graph, please see <</sleep/graph_edit#,Graph editing>>.

=== How should the graphs look?

As a general rule of thumb that applies to healthy individuals:

A healthy sleep (for a monophasic sleeper) is 7-8 hours long and consists of 5 sleep cycles where the first lasts for 70-100 minutes and the consequent cycles get longer but lighter. Each cycle consists of 4 stages lasting usually 5-15 minutes. Stage 1 and 2 are considered light sleep and this is the best time to be woken up in the morning.

A healthy sleep cycle looks like a 10-30 minutes of light sleep (high peaks) followed by an area of deep sleep (low peaks or no peaks) lasting 40-100 minutes.
Different resources on sleep may provide different figures though.

So deep sleep % may actually range between 30%-70%. Figures out of this range may indicate either incorrect sleep tracking setup or some sleep issues. For example very low deep sleep % may indicate either sleep deprivation or issues in your life style such as higher alcohol or caffeine intake, not enough sport etc.
//See examples of such sleep graphs below.
