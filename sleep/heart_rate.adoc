== What it does
*Enhances your sleep tracking data and awake detection.*

If you have a compatible heart rate sensor, you can use it to:

. Gather your heart rate during the night and show it on your sleep graph
. Have much more precise awake detection
. If your wearable supports heart rate variability data collection, you will see HRV on your sleep graph too (read https://sleep.urbandroid.org/hrv-tracking/[more about heart rate variability here])

See and example of a heart-rate enabled track in <<graph-hr>> and heart rate variability graph in <<graph-hrv>>.

== Where to find it

[horizontal]
Enable HR monitoring for fully integrated devices::
  _Settings -> Wearables -> Heart rate monitoring_
  This regards all devices that we explicitly integrated, such as Pebble, Mi Band, Amazefit, Fitbit, Garmin, Wear OS, Samsung Gear/Galaxy. See <</devices/wearables#,Smartwatch and Wearables>> for supported devices.
Enable HR monitoring for devices that support direct HR over BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)::
 _Settings -> Wearables -> Bluetooth Smart_
 This regards all other devices that have a HR sensor (such as Polar H7) and may or may not work with your device.
NOTE: Do not use this option for HR monitoring with compatible smartwatches such as Pebble, Mi Band, Amazefit, Fitbit, Garmin, Wear OS, Samsung Gear/Galaxy, etc.
Enable HR monitoring for a supported oximeter:: If you have an <</devices/oximeter#,oximeter>> connected in _Sleep -> Settings -> Wearables -> Pulse Oximeter_, heart rate will be detected by default.
Enable HRV monitoring:: If your wearable supports HRV data collection, it will be enabled automatically with HR monitoring.
Enable awake detection using heart rate data::
  _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Awake detection -> Heart rate monitoring_

== Guide

=== How to tell if the wearable will collect HR

Only wearables, that use GATT Heart Rate Profile interface can be connected via BT smart for collecting HR data.
If you are not sure, if the HR monitoring is possible with your wearable, you can check, if it is compatible directly in the Sleep app.

. Try to pair with your device (this may not be required for all devices and OS versions).
. Make sure no other app is using your device while sleep tracking.
. Go to _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Bluetooth Smart_ and tick this option.
. The app will start a Bluetooth scanning and lists all nearby devices.
. If your wearable is listed in BT scanning with a icon:tag_love[] icon, it uses the requi red HR profile

NOTE: If your wearable is not listed with a heart icon:tag_love[] icon, you need to go around – save HR to S Health or Google Fit, from where Sleep as Android will download it.

=== Mi Bands
Check your HR settings in the Mi Fit app.
When the Mi Band is in *Sleep Assistant* HR mode in Mi Fit, it doesn’t feed the HR data to Mi Band Tools / Sleep as Android. When it is in regular HR tracking mode (24-hour), it works.

==== Tools&MiBand

. Enable _Heart Rate Monitor_ in T&MB _Left_ ☰ _menu -> Heart Rate_ -> icon:ic_cog[] -> _Heart Rate monitor_

==== Notify&Fitness

. Enable heart rate monitoring in N&F icon:ic_action_graph[] -> _Heart_ section icon:ic_cog[]  -> _Heart monitor_
. Enable collecting HR data by the Sleep app in N&F icon:ic_action_graph[] -> _Sleep_ section icon:ic_cog[] -> _Sleep as Android -> Settings -> Heart monitor_
