== What it does
Records significant sounds while you sleep and builds a ambient noise-level graph for the night. It also <</sleep/sound_recognition#,classifies the sounds>> into categories including snoring, talk, coughing, laughter, baby cry.

NOTE: Enabling Sleep noise recording may lead to higher battery consumption during sleep tracking.

== Where to find it
_Settings -> Sleep noise recording_

You can check whether the phone is recording on the sleep tracking screen - [color-red]#red ⬤# indicates that the phone is currently recording.

On the seek bar to the right you can see current volume level and your _Recording voluem threshold_ which indicates volume to start recording.
