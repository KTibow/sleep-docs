== What it does
*Sleep tracking is a way to objectively measure the quality of your sleep.*

By tracking your sleep, the app enables you to:

. See a sleep graph for every night
. Monitor your long term sleep quality (with <</sleep/sleepscore#,sleep score>> and <</sleep/statistics#,statistics>> )
. Set up goals to improve your sleep quality
. Use <</alarms/smart_wake_up#,smart wake up>> for a pleasant wake up experience

NOTE: See <</sleep/sleep_tracking_theory#, Sleep tracking theory>> for a more in-depth information on how sleep tracking works.

== Where to find it

Start sleep tracking on the app's main screen by tapping *Start sleep tracking*.

Sleep tracking settings can be found in
_Settings -> Sleep tracking_.

== Options
[horizontal]
Awake detection:: See <</sleep/awake_detection#, Awake detection>>
Automatic sleep tracking:: Options for automati tracking, see details at <</sleep/automatic_sleep_tracking#,Automatic sleep tracking>>
//Start sleep tracking:: Set to something other than _Manual only_ to enable automatic sleep tracking start.
//- More details: <<automatic_sleep_tracking, Automatic sleep tracking>>.
//Sleep time estimate:: Do you forget to track your sleep? Enable this to receive sleep length estimates in a notification every day without you doing anything.
//- On _Manual only_, you'll receive a notification that you have to confirm in order to create the sleep record
//- On _Save automatically_, the notification saves the sleep record for you automatically
//- More details: <<sleep_time_estimation,Sleep time estimation>>
//Use Google Sleep API:: Enables the Sleep API by Google (https://developers.google.com/location-context/sleep[you can read more here]).

Sensor:: Choose a sensor that will be used for motion tracking when you track using phone (ie. without wearables or Sleep Phaser). Read more about the available <</sleep/sensors#, Sensors>>.
Wearables:: Chose your wearable as the sleep tracking sensor. See deails on <</devices/wearables#,wearables here>>.
Pair tracking:: Check to enable pair tracking. More details: <</sleep/pair_tracking#,Pair tracking>>.
Test sensor [[test_sensor]]:: Test if your chosen sensor (Sonar or Accelerometer) is working correctly.

WARNING: _Always on clock_ will keep your screen on all night which will significantly affect battery consumption.

Do not disturb when sleeping:: If checked, do not disturb (DND) mode will be enabled during sleep tracking, and disabled again when sleep tracking ends.
Note the following special rules:
- if DND was active before sleep tracking started, Sleep will not touch it (ie. it won't disable it in the morning)
- if DND was activated by Sleep, but you have toggled it during the sleep tracking, Sleep will not touch it again
Priority mode:: Enables Priority DND - this mode allows using customizable exceptions, for example emergency contacts will get through even when DND is activated.
Turn off wireless signal during sleep::
This option tries to disable radios (wifi, cellular) during sleep tracking. Due to constraints gradually introduced in Android, it behaves differently based on the Android version you have on your phone.
*Below 4.2*: turns on airplane mode
*Lollipop (5)*: turns off wifi
*Oreo (8)*: turns off wifi. If you have turned on airplane mode manually, we cannot turn wifi on for features such as IFTTT or Smartlights
*Q (10)*: does nothing - Android 10 has removed any means of controlling wifi programmatically
Stand-by:: Sleep tracking will be put into standby mode when battery drops under level set here. No further sleep data will be collected. This saves battery for the alarm.
Battery optimized [[battery-optimized]]:: This option will enable accelerometer sensor batching, if it is available on your phone. This means that the phone does not have to have CPU awake all night to be able to read data from the sensor.
WARNING: Due to Doze mode, starting from Android 6 we need to schedule a user-visible alarm every minute to be able to use sensor batching. This alarm will never ring, but will be visible on your status bar and lockscreen.
Force screen off tracking:: An option to further force sleep tracking for some phones, which do not support screen off tracking. Use with caution, it may block sleep tracking if used when not needed.

=== How to track sleep
Sleep is always tracked using one main sensor and optionally a handful of additional sensors.

==== Using accelerometer
Accelerometer is present on every phone. It measures its own movement - so the general idea is that your movements during sleep will move the phone.

In case of using accelerometer, the phone has to be on your mattress with you - when you move during the night, phone has to move with you.

.Phone placement when tracking using accelerometer

The accuracy of measured data depends on how well your bed is able to transmit your movement to the phone.

==== Using sonar
Sleep as Android enables you to use the phoneâ€™s microphone and speaker as a sonar (for range and movement detection using ultrasound). It works on a lot of phones, but not all (some are unable to produce or capture frequencies above human hearing range).

https://sleep.urbandroid.org/introducing-sonar-as-sensor/[Read more] about sonar and how we invented it.

==== Using other devices
You can also track sleep with additional devices like <</devices/sleep_phaser#, Sleep Phaser>> and <</devices/wearables#, wearables>>.


=== Sleep tracking screen

<<sleep-tracking-screen-1>> shows common elements of the tracking screen

. Show the progress of the current sleep track from start to alarm time, is only shown if there is an alarm in the next 24 hours.
. Elapsed tracking time
. Current time
. Top right actions
- Pausing icon:ic_action_pause[] sleep tracking when you are awake, see <</sleep/awake#, Awake detection>>.
- Play lullabies icon:ic_action_lullaby[] for faster fall asleep, see <</sleep/lullaby#, Lullabies>>.
- Stop tracking icon:ic_action_cancel[], this will show a confirmation dialog whether you like to delete the record or save it.
. If <</sleep/sleep_noise_recording#, Noise recording>> is enabled, you will see an recording indicator, with current volume and the _Recording volume threshold_.
. Shows your next alarm or a range in case of <</sleep/smart_wake_up#, Smart wake up>> and beneath you can see further instructions depending on your settings
. Action icon:ic_pencil[] to <</sleep/graph_edit#, comment>> or <</sleep/tags#, tag>> your sleep graph and turn on your flash light icon:ic_flashlight[] to e.g. navigate to the toilet.
+
NOTE: In case you have configured <</devices/smart_light#, Smartlight>>, the _Pee-light_ option will use it at minimum brightness (and red if possible) to help you to navigate the room.
+
. Running sleep tracking is always indicated in the status bar as an ongoing notification. Even after leaving the tracking screen you can always get back through this notification.

[[sleep-tracking-screen-1]]

Sliding up the _Stop and Save_ slider will bring up further options show in <<sleep-tracking-screen-2>>.

* _Stop and save_ stops current sleep tracking and immediately saves it. This option is only accessible after the slide to neglect any risk of accidental stop.
* _Pee-light_ uses your phones flashlight or any connected <</devices/smart_light#, Smartlight>>.
* _Save battery_ switches sleep tracking into a low power mode. In this mode tracking will consume minimum battery, but <</sleep/sleep_noise_recording#, Noise recording>> will be stopped and no activity will be tracked using <</sleep/sensors#, Sensors>>. This is useful if you don't have much battery but still want to track the time of your sleep.

=== Testing sensors
You can test sensor function - we recommend testing it especially when using sonar, to make sure sonar is supported on your device.
You should see a green graph, reacting to your movement.

[[test-sensor-accel]]
.Test sensor screen for accelerometer
image::accel_test.png[]

For sonar sensor, you see either "Sonar is supported" message (Fig. 6), which means you can use Sonar. In the middle of the screen, you can see the strength of the signal - the higher number, the better signal.

[[test-sensor-sonar-ok]]
.Test sensor screens for sonar
image::sonar_test.png[]

Or you see "Sonar not supported" message (Fig. 7), which means sonic signal is not reliable or too weak for proper tracking. Sonar signal depends on the quality of speaker and mic, and on the way system treats sound stream - when system for example adds an enhancing filter, the sonar signal can be distorted.
