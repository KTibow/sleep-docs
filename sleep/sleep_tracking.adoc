== What it does
*Sleep tracking is a way to objectively measure the quality of your sleep.*

By tracking your sleep, the app enables you to:

. See a sleep graph for every night
. Monitor your long term sleep quality (with <</sleep/sleepscore#,sleep score>> and <</sleep/statistics#,statistics>> )
. Set up goals to improve your sleep quality
. Use <</alarms/smart_wake_up#,smart wake up>> for a pleasant wake up experience

NOTE: See <</sleep/sleep_tracking_theory#, Sleep tracking theory>> for a more in-depth information on how sleep tracking works.

== Where to find it

Start sleep tracking on the app's main screen by tapping *Start sleep tracking*.

Sleep tracking settings can be found in
_Settings -> Sleep tracking_.

== Options
[horizontal]
Smart wake up:: See <</alarms/smart_wake_up#,Smart wake up>>
Awake detection:: See <</sleep/awake_detection#, Awake detection>>

.Automatic sleep tracking
[horizontal]
Start sleep tracking:: Set to something other than _Manual only_ to enable automatic sleep tracking start.
- More details: <<automatic_sleep_tracking, Automatic sleep tracking>>.
Sleep time estimate:: Do you forget to track your sleep? Enable this to receive sleep length estimates in a notification every day without you doing anything.
- On _Manual only_, you'll receive a notification that you have to confirm in order to create the sleep record
- On _Save automatically_, the notification saves the sleep record for you automatically
- More details: <<sleep_time_estimation,Sleep time estimation>>

.Sensor
[horizontal]
Sensor:: Choose a sensor that will be used for motion tracking when you track using phone (ie. without wearables or Sleep Phaser). Read more about the available <</sleep/sensors#, Sensors>>
Test sensor:: Test if your chosen sensor (Sonar or Accelerometer) is working correctly. If you want to test your wearable for motion tracking, please instead use _Settings -> Wearables -> Test sensor_.

.Pair tracking
[horizontal]
Pair tracking:: Check to enable pair tracking. More details: <</sleep/pair_tracking#,Pair tracking>>.
Find partner:: Tap simultaneously on two phones that are close together to form a pair.

.Do not disturb when sleeping
[horizontal]
Do not disturb when sleeping:: If checked, do not disturb (DND) mode will be enabled during sleep tracking, and disabled again when sleep tracking ends.
Note the following special rules:
- if DND was active before sleep tracking started, Sleep will not touch it (ie. it won't disable it in the morning)
- if DND was activated by Sleep, but you have toggled it during the sleep tracking, Sleep will not touch it again
Turn off wireless signal during sleep::
This option tries to disable radios (wifi, cellular) during sleep tracking. Due to constraints gradually introduced in Android, it behaves differently based on the Android version you have on your phone.
Below 4.2: turns on airplane mode
Lollipop (5): turns off wifi
Oreo (8): turns off wifi. If you have turned on airplane mode manually, we cannot turn wifi on for features such as IFTTT or Smartlights
Q (10): does nothing - Android 10 has removed any means of controlling wifi programmatically

.Advanced
[horizontal]
Screen dimming:: Controls what will happen to the phone screen while sleep tracking.
  Disabled::: Sleep does nothing, your system screen timeout applies
  Dim::: Screen dims, your system screen timeout applies
  Dim with clock::: Screen dims, shows time, your system screen timeout applies
  Always on clock::: Screen dims, shows time, your system timeout DOES NOT apply
WARNING: _Always on clock_ will keep your screen on all night which will significantly affect battery consumption.
Stand-by:: Sleep tracking will be put into standby mode when battery drops under level set here. No further sleep data will be collected. This saves battery for the alarm.
Battery optimized [[battery-optimized]]:: This option will enable accelerometer sensor batching, if it is available on your phone. This means that the phone does not have to have CPU awake all night to be able to read data from the sensor.
WARNING: Due to Doze mode, starting from Android 6 we need to schedule a user-visible alarm every minute to be able to use sensor batching. This alarm will never ring, but will be visible on your status bar and lockscreen.

== Guide

=== How to track sleep
Sleep is always tracked using one main sensor and optionally a handful of additional sensors.

==== Using accelerometer
Accelerometer is present on every phone. It measures its own movement - so the general idea is that your movements during sleep will move the phone.

In case of using accelerometer, the phone has to be on your mattress with you - when you move during the night, phone has to move with you.

The accuracy of measured data depends on how well your bed is able to transmit your movement to the phone.

==== Using sonar
Sleep as Android enables you to use the phoneâ€™s microphone and speaker as a sonar (for range and movement detection using ultrasound). It works on a lot of phones, but not all (some are unable to produce or capture frequencies above human hearing range). See the <</sleep/sonar_devices#,list of compatible devices>>.

==== Using other devices
You can also track sleep with additional devices like <</devices/sleep_phaser#, Sleep Phaser>> and <</devices/wearables#, wearables>>.
