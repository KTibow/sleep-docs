== What it does
*Sleep score is a complete summary of your sleep health.*

Sleep score draws a lot of inspiration from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Sleep_Quality_Index[Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index].

== Where to find it
- on the Dashboard, one of the cards is a Sleep Score card.
- in _Left ☰ menu -> Trend -> Trend tab -> Sleep score chart_

== How it looks like

[[awake-detection-settings]]
.Your current sleep score. You get one point for each dimension that is in healthy range.

=== Sleep score charts colors

We use [color-green]#green-ish# for healthy range and [color-red]#red-ish# for unfavourable range. The exact color may depend on the color palette.

Values above the average may mean some error of measurement – for example the phone was not close enough to the body. Values under average may indicate too much light sleep due to various factors such as stress, alcohol consumption, loud environment etc…

In long-term perspective, diversion from the average may indicate some issue. The Advice card on the main Dashboard <</sleep/advice#advicecard, from the Advice section>> will warn you, if the app detects any unfavourable trend in your data.

=== Sleep score dimensions

There are eight dimensions that contribute to sleep quality. Each of the dimensions has a healthy range and an unhealthy range:

[NOTE]
====
[[note-age]]
Healthy durations are adjusted according to your age as defined in _Settings -> Stats -> Year of birth_

* General or not set (6.5 - 9)
* School age (9 - 11)
* Teenager (8 - 10),
* Young (7 - 9)
* Elderly (6 - 9)

If you’re in the healthy range for a certain dimension, it lights up green and you get one point. Every line can also turn red if the values are in a very unfavourable range.

NOTE: If you are missing some charts, it means you do not have the required sensor, or the app does not have enough data to estimate it. If your irregularity pie chart is missing, there are probably gaps in the graphs. You can consider <</sleep/automatic_sleep_tracking#, Automatic tracking start>> or <</sleep/sleep_time_estimation#, Sleep time estimation>> features, if you often forget to start the tracking.
