== What it does
.Plays you a lullaby when you get to bed to help you fall asleep better.

For lullabies, you can use *built-in lullabies*, your *own music*, or you can mix in *binaural beats*.

*Built-in lullabies* are composed of repetitive sounds making your brain tired and sleepy, and sudden sounds for complete and rich experience stimulating your fantasy.
Five lullabies are build in for free, five additional lullabies available after unlocking the app and many more with the https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.addon.lullaby[Sleep Lullaby extension pack].

For playing your *own music* (external player, Spotify, listening to audiobooks), you can use the feature "Turn off when sleeping", which is watching for you falling asleep and then will start a countdown for the set time. After that, it will gradually lower the system media volume.

*Binaural beats* mix real-time generated binaural tones into lullaby playback. Read more about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)#Binaural_beats[binaural beats].
