== Snooze

=== What it does
Allows you to delay your wake up if you do not yet feel rested in order to get additional period of sleep, or restrict those delays.

=== Where to find it
*Settings > Alarm default settings > Snooze*
or
*per-alarm settings > Snooze*

=== Options
[horizontal]
Snooze duration:: the main option of snooze on alarm screen (the only one or the biggest button).
Snooze limit:: the maximum count of snoozing you are allowed. When this number is reached, only dismiss button is on the alarm screen.
Maximum total snooze time:: the maximum time you are allowed to snooze. When this time is reached, only dismiss button is on the alarm screen.
Halve Snooze:: each consecutive snooze duration is halved.
Changing snooze time:: allows changing snooze duration on alarm screen (enables selection of different snoozes).
Snooze after alarm time:: snoozing may be completely disabled after the alarm time has been reached (works only for smart alarm)
NOTE: if your alarm is set to 7:00 and due to smart wake-up it rings at 6:57, the longest possible snooze will be 3 minutes.
