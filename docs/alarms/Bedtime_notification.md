# Bedtime notification

Bedtime notification is an effective way to maintain optimal sleep length or fight high sleep deficits. You can set the notification to trigger from 5 minutes to 2 hours before bedtime in order to give you enough time to prepare for bed. 

> The time to trigger the notification is calculated as follows:
> _time to bed = next alarm time – ideal daily sleep income_



**Where to find it:**
_Settings > Bedtime notification_
**What it does:**
Notifies you when you should go to bed in order to maintain optimal sleep lenght.

**Options:**
* **Bedtime notification:** - sets a time, when the bedtime notification is triggered
* **Repeat** - sets an interval of the notification repetition
  >  e.g. 10 minutes repeat will notify you once on notification time and every 10 minutes unless you slide the notification away from your notification list.
* **Smart bedtime** - adjust the timing of bedtime notification according to your sleep deficit for the last 5 days, average length of the smart wake up period, and default pause at the beginning of sleep tracking
  > smart time to bed = next alarm – ideal daily sleep inc. – smart period – delayed tracking – in(5 days avg. sleep deficit > 10 min, 45 min)
