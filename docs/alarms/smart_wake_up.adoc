== What it does
*Looks for the best moment to wake you up.*

Waking up in light sleep feels natural - like on a weekend, without any alarm.
In contrast, deep sleep wakeup (which is common with ordinary alarm clocks) leads to an unpleasant experience accompanied with feeling of tiredness, sleepiness, disorientation.

With smart wake up, you set up a time window (also smart wake up period), in which youâ€™d like to be woken up once it is the right moment.

[EXAMPLE]
Alarm time: 8:00
Smart period: 30 minutes (default)
Sleep as Android will wake you between 7:30-8:00, once you are in light sleep for some time. The scheduled alarm time (8:00) is considered as the last possible wake up time.

== Where to find it
_Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Smart wake up_

== Options
[horizontal]
Smart period:: Set the smart period - time window before alarm to be awoken in.
* Disabled - alarm goes off at alarm time exactly
* Power nap - special type of smart period, see link:../alarms/power_nap.html[Power nap]
* 5 minutes - 2 hour - alarm goes of during the selected period prior to alarm time
Nap smart period:: sets a smart period for naps with tracking and naps from shortcuts
* Disabled - alarm goes off at alarm nap time
* Power nap - special type of smart period, see link:../alarms/power_nap.html[Power nap]
* 5 minutes - 2 hour - alarm goes of during the selected period prior to alarm time

== Advanced options
[horizontal]
[[sensitivity]]
Movement intensity:: Adjust sensitivity of smart alarm. With less sensitivity, you need more noticeable movement to trigger alarm.
Movement occurrence:: Adjust sensitivity of smart alarm. With less sensitivity, you need more frequent movement to trigger alarm.
Not before ideal sleep:: Does not allow the alarm to ring before reaching either ideal sleep duration or alarm time. If enabled, can lead to ignoring the smart period for the sake of reaching sleep duration closest to ideal sleep duration.
