== What it does
*Alarm TODO text*

NOTE: For even better experience with alarms, see also link:../alarms/smart_wake_up.html[Smart wake up]

== Where to find it
Alarms can be modified at two places - for one specific alarm in per-alarm settings, and for all alarms in Alarm default settings.

._Sleep as Android -> Settings -> Alarm default settings_
Default settings allows you to modify behaviour for all your alarms. Default settings are also applied to all new alarms.

._Per-alarm settings_
Per-alarm settings change behaviour of a specific alarm; those changes won't affect other alarms or default settings.


== Options

[horizontal]
Ringtone:: See link:../alarms/ringtone.html[Ringtone].
Gentle volume increase:: Alarm starts at minimum volume and gradually increase to phone maximum.
* Disabled - Alarm rings at volume set in link:../alarms/ringtone.html[Ringtone] section
* 1-24 minutes - Sets how long it takes to reach the max volume; the longer the period, the slower the volume increases and the longer it takes to reach the max.
Vibrate:: Enables phone vibrations (do not confuse with vibrations on wearable).
* Disabled - No vibrations on phone at all.
* From start - Vibrations start at alarm time.
* After 1-24 minutes - Sets a delay for vibrations.
Alarm sound start::
* From start - Sound starts at alarm time.
* 1-24 minutes - Sets a delay for sound.

== Guide
[horizontal]
Create alarm only as vibrations on watch (no sound)::
NOTE: We highly recommend to set a sound delay instead of setting the alarm silent, especially when backup alarm is silent too.
. Set the alarm silent (_per-alarm settings -> Ringtone -> Silent_) or set the delay on sound (_Settings -> Alarm default setting -> Sound delay_).
. Enable wearable vibrations (_Settings -> Wearables -> Vibrate_).

Create silent alarm::
NOTE: We highly recommend to set a sound delay instead of setting the alarm silent, especially when backup alarm is silent too.
. Set the alarm silent (_per-alarm settings -> Ringtone -> Silent_).
. This option is available only in per-alarm settings, not in Alarm default settings.
Postpone next alarm::
NOTE: Works only for repeating alarms.
. Open alarm -> Postpone next alarm.
. Use the sliding bar or the drop down menu list for postponing alarm.
. Confirm the alarm time change.
Skip next alarm::
NOTE: Works only for repeated alarms.
. Open an alarm -> Skip next, confirm the change.
. Or long press on the alarm on alarm board -> Skip next.
Dismiss alarm before alarm time::
NOTE: won't deactivate the alarm completely, so it has no effect on next alarms.
. Open before alarm notification (appears one hour before alarm) from the notification bar on your phone.
. Dismiss from the notification.
Use my own sound as alarm::
. Open Ringtone selection: _Settings -> Alarm default settings -> Ringtone_ or _per-alarm settings -> Ringtone_.
. Tap on folder (TODO) icon in right upper corner.
