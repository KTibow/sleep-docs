== What it does

CAPTCHA is another very effective tool in preventing oversleeping - a little task which needs to be solved first before the alarm gets dismissed.
Prove you are a human even though you sleep as android!

== Where to find it

_Settings > CAPTCHA: Stop oversleeping!_
_per-alarm settings > CAPTCHA: Stop oversleeping!_

NOTE: CAPTCHA can also be configured per alarm, so you can override your CAPTCHA settings and use a different CAPTCHA with more difficult settings on special occasions (e.g. exams) or easier CAPTCHA on the weekends

== Advanced Options

Prevent escaping CAPTCHA:: Prevents you to force closing or uninstalling the app

NOTE: During CAPTCHA solving, alarm volume is lowered for 2 minutes so that you don’t wake your partner with the ongoing alarm. You can use the 2 minutes either to solve the CAPTCHA or get to a different room for solving.

== QR code and NFC tag CAPTCHA

The QR and NFC CAPTCHAs are the ultimate solution for waking up. You can place a QR code or NFC tag in your bathroom or kitchen. The alarm than won’t stop until you get out of bed and scan the code/tag.

QR CAPTCHA:: You can use any barcode or QR code (there are many free online QR code generators).
Supported QR apps: Barcode Scanner, QRDroid, Google Goggles
NFC CAPTCHA:: You can use any credit card, some membership cards or ID cards
For security reasons, NFC Captcha requires unlocking the screen
