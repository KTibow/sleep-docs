# CAPTCHA
CAPTCHA is another very effective tool in preventing oversleeping - a little task which needs to be solved first before the alarm gets dismissed.
Proove you are a human even though you sleep as android!

**Where to find it:**
_Settings > CAPTCHA: Stop oversleeping!_
_per-alarm settings > CAPTCHA: Stop oversleeping!_
> NOTE: CAPTCHA can also be configured per alarm, so you can override your CAPTCHA settings and use a different CAPTCHA with more difficult settings on special occasions (e.g. exams) or easier CAPTCHA on the weekends

**What it does:**
Forces you to solve a simple task before dismissing the alarm to prove you are fully awake

**Options:**
* **Default CAPTCHA**
  * **Simple math** - select the correct answer
  * **Typed math** - write the correct answer
  * **Sleeping sheep** - find an awake sheep

**Advanced Options:**

* **Prevent escaping CAPTCHA** - prevents you to force closing or uninstalling the app

> During CAPTCHA solving, alarm volume is lowered for 2 minutes so that you don’t wake your partner with the ongoing alarm. You can use the 2 minutes either to solve the CAPTCHA or get to a different room for solving.
