## What it does

*<</sleep/sensors#sonar, Sonar>> or the <</devices/sleep_phaser_2, Sleep phaser>> is so sensitive we can even measure your abdominal movements and thus estimate your breath rate.*

Any pause in in the detected breath rates is depicted as an O2 symbol icon::ic_action_cpap[] in the sleep graph and may hint at respiratory issues or cause by an outage of the sensor.

Using <</devices/oximeter, Oximeter>> we can track blood oxygenation levels (SPO2) directly. Oximeters provide a better and more precise respiratory issues tracking. They can even hint on any severe issues such as the link:https://sleep.urbandroid.org/sleep-apnea-pulse-oximetry/[Sleep apnea].

## Where to find it

No action is required. You will see breath rates if you use the <</sleep/sensors#sonar, Sonar>> or the <</devices/sleep_phaser_2, Sleep phaser>> if the overall setting in your bedroom and the device in use reach the required level of sensitivity.

With an oximeter, you can track your blood oxygen levels (SpO~2~). See <</devices/oximeter#,Oximeter docs>> for details.

## Options
In _Settings -> Wearables_:

[horizontal]
Low breath rate alarm:: If enabled, this will wake you up if you have a low breathing rate (or blood oxygen level) for a while.

## Guide
A blue line on your sleep graph shows breath/oxygen data from connected devices, see <<breath-line>>.

Whenever a significant dip in value occurs, a O2 symbol icon::ic_action_cpap[] will be shown in the graph. This is a _breathing disturbance_. From those disturbances, we compute your <<RDI>> value.

### RDI
*Respiratory Disturbance Index* is the average count of respiratory disturbance episodes per hour.
E.g. if you stop breathing once per every hour of your sleep, RDI would be 1.

[horizontal]
0 - 10:: RDI under 10 is considered normal, some of the disturbance events measure may be faults of the sensor and how tight the sensor is around your finger for instance.
10 - 15:: RDI from 10 to 15 is considered a mild respiratory disturbance. We strongly recommend to do the measurements repeatedly to minimize any errors in measurement
15 - 30:: RDI from 15 to 30 is considered moderate respiratory disturbance. It can be a warning sign. Definitely do measurement repeatedly to verify this result.
30 and more:: RDI over 30 is considered severe. We recommend to consult your doctor.
