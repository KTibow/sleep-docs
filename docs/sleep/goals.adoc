== What it does
Helps you actively improve your sleep habits.

Goals are free to use – but let’s be honest to ourselves. Motivation to change your habits is much higher if there is something tangible at stake. Let’s say a few dollars.

_Left ☰ menu -> Goal_

// == Options
// Describe all the feature's options, see other docs pages for formatting

. Select area in which you’d like to improve over the next 1 month (Duration, Fall asleep hour, Irregularity, Awake, Deep sleep, Snoring, Snooze)
. Choose your motivation. You can try the goal for free, or you can bet a few bucks on yourself.
  * You can bet a smaller wager or a bigger wager. In the US, a small wager is around $2, big wager around $4. When you select the wager and confirm the goal, you will see the exact price and then you can confirm or decline the payment.

  - [.line-through]#$# = free
  - $ = about $2
  - +++$$+++ = about $4
