# Back up

Sleep as Android provides several ways to backup and export your data.
You can manually download your data as .csv file and backup anywhere you want or you can also use the data for your own analysis.

**Where to find it:**
_â‰¡ Left menu > Back up_

**What it does:**
Export / import data

**Options:**
* **Export** - all your sleep records will be exported to a csv file located at _/sdcard/sleep-data/sleep-export.csv_.
* **Import** - initiate import of data from /sdcard/sleep-data/sleep-export.csv.
  > Import will just import new records that are present in this file and they are missing in your Sleep as Android database. It will not delete or modify any of existing sleep records you already have in the application.
