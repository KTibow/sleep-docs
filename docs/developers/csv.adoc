Tz:: Timezone
From:: Record beginning datetime

Sched:: Next scheduled sleep tracking terminating alarm
Hours:: Duration of the sleep record
Rating:: User rating (0.0 â€“ 5.0 with 0.25 step)
Comment:: User comments and tags
Framerate:: unused
Snore:: snoring value (-1: snoring detection was turned off, 0: snoring detection on, no snoring detected)
Noise:: noise average value
Cycles:: sleep cycles measured (-1: manually inserted sleep record)
DeepSleep:: deep sleep aggregated value (-2.0 or -1.0: no hypnogram)
LenAdjust:: adjusts record length in case of any awake period (fall asleep period, pause, awake detection)
