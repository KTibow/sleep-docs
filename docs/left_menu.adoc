.Chronotype

Based on your sleep patterns in tracking history, the app will determine your chronotype and shows you the icon in the Left menu - either you are morning lark, or night owl.

NOTE: The app needs to have at least one month of sleep data.

Your chronotype is then represented by a banner at the very top of the Left ☰ menu.

According to the research of professor https://www.amazon.com/Internal-Time-Chronotypes-Social-Youre-dp-0674065859/dp/0674065859/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=[Till Roenneberg],  people are born with a chronotype, and  everyone is somewhere on the spectrum from owl 100% to 100% lark. Our https://sleep.urbandroid.org/sleepcloud-study/[SleepCloud study] also came to the same conclusion.
