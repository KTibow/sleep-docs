Sleep as Android is translated to many world languages, thanks to our volunteer translators. We could never do that without you!

## Can you help us with the translations?

There are new features added all the time which need new strings, which in turn need to be translated. Can you give us a hand with it? Please ask for permission to access our translation spreadsheets:
