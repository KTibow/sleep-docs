Sleep as Android has a lot of functionality, some of which can be only enabled with permissions from the user. See below for explanation of usage of each permission.

|Location
|Approximate location (network-based), precise location (GPS and network-based)
a|- Sunrise wakeup
- Location tagging
- Morning weather
- Pair tracking
- Bluetooth-connected devices, such as link:/docs/connected_devices/oximeter.html[Oximeter]

a|We use approximate location (network-based) to implement some of the cool location based features. We gather the location data and make them more coarse to +/- 5 km.

For all of this, we would be okay with _approximate location_ permission. However for _bluetooth connecting_ and _pair tracking_ features, we have to also ask for _precise location_.

You can completely opt-out from location storing in _Settings -> Miscellaneous_.
