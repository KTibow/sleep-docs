Sleep as Android has a lot of functionality, some of which can be only enabled with permissions from the user. See below for explanation of usage of each permission.

[Attributes]
|===
|Permission |Google's description |Used by feature | Notes

.<|Contacts
|Find accounts on the device
a|- In-app purchases
- link:/docs/connected_services/google_calendar.html[Google Calendar]
|We don’t need your contacts. However this is the only permission that grants us access to your account name (like user@gmail.com).

We need your contact name to be able to secure in-app purchases – please note that this permission does NOT include retrieval of any authentication information (login, password).

We also use this permission to retrieve accounts for the Google Calendar integration (when you enable the Calendar option)

For official Android information, please see: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#permission-groups (you can see that the GET_ACCOUNTS permission is in the CONTACTS permission group)

|Identity
|Find accounts on the device
a|- In-app purchases
- link:/docs/connected_services/google_calendar.html[Google Calendar]
|Only for Lollipop and below, otherwise it's the same case as the Contacts permission - we need it to retrieve account names that are on your device in order to secure In-app purchases and connect to services such as Google Calendar.

|Location
|Approximate location (network-based), precise location (GPS and network-based)
a|- Sunrise wakeup
- Location tagging
- Morning weather
- Pair tracking
- Bluetooth-connected devices, such as link:/docs/connected_devices/oximeter.html[Oximeter]

a|We use approximate location (network-based) to implement some of the cool location based features. We gather the location data and make them more coarse to +/- 5 km.

For all of this, we would be okay with _approximate location_ permission. However for _bluetooth connecting_ and _pair tracking_ features, we have to also ask for _precise location_.

You can completely opt-out from location storing in _Settings -> Miscellaneous_.

|Microphone
|Record audio
a|- link:/docs/sleep_basic/sleep_noise_recording.html[Sleep noise recording]

a|- link:/docs/sleep_basic/sleep_noise_recording.html[Sleep noise recording]
