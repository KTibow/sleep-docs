== What it does
*Measures the level of ambient light in your bedroom using the ambient light sensor (lux sensor)*

When awake detection is enabled, light is being measured during sleep tracking.

You will see light level plotted on your sleep graph (in the same way as heart rates or breath is plotted), in lux units.
_#dark_ / _#light_ tags will be added to your sleep records.
If there is disturbing light (more than 30 lux) after sunset, we consider it as an Awake period.

The _#dark_ tag is added when you have less than 30 lux for at least 90% of the night.
The _#light_ tag is added when you have more than 60 lux for at least 33% of the night.

Light measurement also plays a role in link:/docs/sleep_basic/automatic_sleep_tracking[Automatic sleep tracking].

## Where to find it
