## What it does
*Checks your breath rate to hint you whether you should get examined by a physician for sleep apnea.*

With Sleep Phaser or an oximeter, Sleep as Android enables you to track your breathing rate/oxygen levels and show them on a sleep graph.

## Where to find it
1. With a Sleep Phaser, you can track your breath rate. See <</docs/devices/sleep_phaser#,Sleep Phaser docs>> for details.
2. With an oximeter, you can track your blood oxygen levels (SpO~2~). See <</docs/devices/oximeter#,Oximeter docs>> for details.

## Options
In _Settings -> Wearables_:

[horizontal]
Low breath rate alarm:: If enabled, this will wake you up if you have a low breathing rate (or blood oxygen level) for a while.

## Guide
A blue line on your sleep graph shows breath/oxygen data from connected devices.

Whenever a significant dip in value occurs, a CPAP mask symbol will be shown on the graph. This is a _breathing disturbance_. From those disturbances, we compute your <<RDI>> value.

### RDI
*Respiratory Disturbance Index* is the average count of respiratory distubance episodes per hour.

E.g. if you stop breathing once per every hour of your sleep, RDI would be 1.
