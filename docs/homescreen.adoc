== What it does
You can personalize your main screen of Sleep with three different home screen types.

*Dashboard* is the default home screen, presenting all options in cards. Dashboard is very customizable - you can choose which cards are active, and also pin your most favourite one at the top.

*Tabs home screen* displays alarm list as the main screen, all other options are available in tabs. You can choose which tabs are shown.

*Alarms* is a special, simplified  mode, when you are using only alarms and do not care about the tracking at all.
The main screen shows list of your alarms. This mode hides all sleep tracking related settings.
