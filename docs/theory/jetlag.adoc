## What it does
*Prevents jet lag with short flashes of light during the night.*

A link:https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/02/study-finds-possible-new-jet-lag-treatment.html[2016 study from Stanford University School of Medicine] found that short flashes of light during sleep can shift your melatonine cycle. This can be used to prevent jet lag.

## Where to find it
_Sleep as Android -> Settings -> Jet lag prevention_

## Options

[horizontal]
Enabled:: Enables _Jet lag prevention_. Don't forget to set _Target timezone_.
Tutorial:: ...
Target timezone:: Select the timezone to which you'll be traveling. You can choose either by GMT offset or by city.

## Guide
Before traveling abroad, enable *Jet lag prevention* and set *Target timezone*.

Each hour of timezone difference requires a day of adjustment. If you travel e.g. 4 timezones away, start 4 days before the departure.

Every night, during sleep tracking, the app will be intermittently flashing. We use 2ms flashes every 15 seconds.

The source of flashes will be the phone's LED or a smartlight if you have it set up (see link:/docs/connected_devices/smart_light.html[Smartlight] to find out how to do that).
