== What it does

Advice shows your current sleep development in glance. You see which parameters of your sleep are improving or worsening recently including tips on how to reverse the worsening trends.

== Where to find it

Advice is accessible in *â˜° -> Advice* or you can access it from a Dashboard card.

== General description

Advice measures recent trends in the main sleep dimensions (Duration, Irregularity, Deep sleep %, Snoring, Social jet-lag...).

In most cases it compares your last 60 days aggregates to the last 7 days aggregates and look for significant recent worsening or improvements.

For some dimensions there are checks to be withing bounds set by public medical studies.

Advice also looks at your tags and tells you when there is an increased occurrence of e.g. #alcohol as a caution or #sport as good trend.

Advice also compares your sleep figures with the average data measured by the app for your peers in your country.

== Measured dimensions

[horizontal]
Duration:: Recent worsening or improvements (last 7 days to last 60 days).

In bounds check, general (6.5 - 9), school age (9 - 11), teenager (8 - 10), young (7 - 9), elderly (6 - 9).

Check if it meets your link:/docs/ideal_daily_sleep.html[Ideal daily sleep] target.

Compare to others in your country.

Irregularity::Recent worsening or improvements (last 7 days to last 60 days).

In bounds check (1 hour - 20 minutes).

Deep sleep %:: Recent worsening or improvements (last 7 days to last 60 days).

In bounds check (25% - 75%).

Snoring::Recent worsening or improvements (last 7 days to last 60 days).

Warns if over 30 minutes, and a more severe warning over 60 minutes.

Social jet-lag:: In bounds check (1 hour - 20 minutes).


== Types of advice cards

[horizontal]
Congrats:: Shows an improvement in one of the measured dimensions
Caution:: Shows a worsening with tips how to improve and links to setup link:/docs/sleep_advanced/goals.html[Goals].
Neutral:: Not clearly a positive or negative message. E.g. if other people in your country are getting less sleep it is not directly a positive or negative message. Or if your custom tag e.g. #work is occuring a lot lately we cannot say it is good or bad.


== Examples

Congrats:: Your SNORING is down by 5 minutes lately
Caution:: Your DURATION is down by 30 minutes lately
Neutral:: Others in your country are getting 54 minutes more DURATION
Caution:: Your SNORING is over 50 minutes
