== What it does
*Any sleep graph can be further edited. You can rate the sleep, add additional awake periods, cut excess time, and add tags or comments.*

== Where to find it
_On any sleep graph, tap the pencil_  icon:ic_pencil[] _button_.

== Guide
=== Rating sleep
[cols="2,1"]
|===
a|Rate your sleep by tapping on the stars.

0 = worst sleep, 5 - best sleep.

NOTE: If you leave the rating untouched, it won't count towards your statistics. If you touch it and drag it to zero, it will count as 0.

- If at least one end of the selected period is touching the start or end of the graph, the whole period is cut off from the graph (the graph is shortened).
- When the selected period is within the graph, the period is transformed into awake period, and its duration is subtracted from sleep duration.
