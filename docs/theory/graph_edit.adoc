a|By rating each sleep, you add priceless feedback to sleep statistics. Your subjective feeling is one of the most important aspect of sleep quality. If you rate your sleep conscientiously, you can review the influence of other sleep aspects on your satisfaction with sleep - e.g. how well rested you feel depending on fall asleep hour.
Rating is especially useful when combined with tags - you can evaluate for example the influence of coffee (or alcohol, or stress) on your feeling in the morning.

a|Tap on the section of the graph you wish to edit.
This section gets zoomed in for more precise selection with the bars.
You can also enter the correct times in the time stamp manually.
When the period is selected, tap on the scissors icon in the upper right corner.
When at least one end of the selected period is touching the beginning, or end of the tracking, the whole period is cut off from the graph (the graph is shortened).

When the selected period is within the graph, the period is transformed into awake period, and its duration is subtracted from Sleep duration.
