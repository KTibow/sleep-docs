a|By rating each sleep, you add priceless feedback to sleep statistics. Your subjective feeling is one of the most important aspect of sleep quality. If you rate your sleep conscientiously, you can review the influence of other sleep aspects on your satisfaction with sleep - e.g. how well rested you feel depending on fall asleep hour.
Rating is especially useful when combined with tags - you can evaluate for example the influence of coffee (or alcohol, or stress) on your feeling in the morning.
