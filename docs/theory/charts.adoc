== What it does
*Charts enable you to study your sleep from a long-term perspective.*

Charts are here to help you find patterns in your sleep and enable you to decide for evidence-based changes.

== Where to find it
_Sleep -> Left ☰ menu -> Trends_

== Guide

Date range: Each chart is computed from data within a certain date range. This range is controlled by the first dropdown menu in the top bar.

Tags: All charts can be configured to be only computed from sleep records with a certain tag. You can select the tag in the second dropdown menu in the top bar.

==== Sleep score
[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|image:charts/trend/sleepscore.png[]
a|*Sleep score* radar chart is another way of looking at your link:/docs/theory/sleepscore.html[sleep score]. You can fill each of the sleep score section with up to 5 points.
The more points you have in a given section, the more healthy that factor of your sleep is.

.How should it look?
The goal is of course to fill up that chart completely!

==== Deficit
[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|image:charts/trend/deficit.png[]
a|*Deficit* chart is useful for tracking your sleep deficit.

- *Blue line*: shows the deficit on a given day. If you sleep less then your link:/docs/ideal_daily_sleep.html[ideal sleep time], the blue line will be negative on that day. If you sleep more, it will be positive.

- *Red / green line*: This line shows the total deficit/surplus. The most interesting point of the deficit chart is the rightmost point of this line. If it's red, it means that you have a sleep debt currently. If it's green, you are oversleeping your target.

.How should it look?
You should strive to have zero sleep deficit, so ideally all of the lines should aim to be around 0 hours all the time.

==== Duration
[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|image:charts/trend/duration.png[]
a|*Duration* chart shows you the evolution of your sleep lengths.

* *Blue line*: Shows all-time average duration.
* *Green line*: Either shows actual duration (when date range is quarter-year or lower) on a given day or a 30-day average (when date range is half-year or higher).
** Actual duration: Each point corresponds to the sleep duration on that day.
** 30-day average: Each point on this line is the average sleep duration of that day and each day in the past 30 days from it.
[EXAMPLE]
The point at 30 May is the average of sleep durations from 1 May through 30 May.
The point at 4 May is the average of sleep duration from 5 April through 4 May.

.How should it look?
The chart should not have many extremes (regular, periodic chart is normal).

==== Deep sleep %
[cols="1,2"]
|===
a|image:charts/trend/deepsleep_percentage.png[]
a|*Deep sleep %* chart shows you how your deep sleep has been changing recently – effectively how well did you sleep.

* *Deep blue line*: Shows actual deep sleep percentage on a given day.
* *Light blue line*: Shows all-time average deep sleep percentage.

.How should it look?
The average should be kept over 30%.
