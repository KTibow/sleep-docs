== What it does
Records significant sounds while you sleep. It also <</docs/sleep_basic/sound_recognition,classifies the sounds>> into categories.

NOTE: Enabling Sleep noise recording may lead to higher battery consumption during sleep tracking.

== Where to find it

You can check whether the phone is recording on the sleep tracking screen - red light indicates that the phone is currently recording.
