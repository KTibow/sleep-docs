Sleep as Android integrates Garmin wearables that support the ConnectIQ (CIQ) platform. Please check whether your watch supports the ConnectIQ platform here: link:https://www.wareable.com/garmin/garmin-connect-iq-guide-best-apps-122[ConnectIQ devices] (Garmin does not have an official list of devices that support CIQ).

## How to set up
The Garmin integration consists of three parts:

* link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.garmin[Garmin Addon for Sleep as Android] on the phone
* link:https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/e80a4793-f5a3-44c7-bd7f-52a97f5d8310[Sleep as Android] on the watch (install through the ConnectIQ Store in Garmin Connect app)

Make sure that all of the apps are installed, and then select *Sleep -> Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearables -> Garmin*.
