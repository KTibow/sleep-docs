Sleep as Android supports most Samsung wearables, but not all. Please look for your device in <<supported-watches>> below.

## How to set up
The Samsung Galaxy Gear integration consists of three parts:
* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep[Sleep as Android] on the phone
* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.addon.generic.samsung[Sleep as Android Gear Addon] on the phone
* https://galaxy.store/sle[Sleep as Android - Native Gear Companion] on the watch (install through the Galaxy Gear Store)

Make sure that all of the apps are installed, and then select *Sleep -> Settings -> Wearables -> Use wearables -> Samsung Gear / Galaxy Watch*.
