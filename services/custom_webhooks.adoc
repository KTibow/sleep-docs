== What it does
*Allows you to POST events from Sleep as Android to a custom URL endpoint.*

== Where to find it
_Settings -> Services -> Automation -> Webhooks_

== Guide

=== Setup
. Enable the _Webhooks_ option
. Tap the URL option and fill in the URL of your server/application, including _http://_ or _https://_ .
. Tap ok. It's done!

=== Format of the POST request
On every event, Sleep as Android will POST a request with a JSON body in the following format:

....
{
    "event" : "event_name",
    "value1" : "",
    "value2" : "",
    "value3" : ""
}
....

The `event` field will have a value of one of the <</services/automation#events,event names>>. The `valueX` fields will be only present if not empty.
