== What it does
*Make sure to never lose your data with either local manual backup or automated cloud backup.*

== Where to find it
- _Left_ ≡ _menu -> Backup_
- _Settings -> Services -> Cloud backup_

== Options
._Left ☰ menu -> Backup_
[horizontal]
Export data:: Exports all your sleep records, noises and preferences to ZIP files located on your phone at _/sdcard/sleep-data/_. Use for  <<local_backup,local backup>> or for your <<csv_export, own analysis>> of sleep tracking data. The command also zips up the CSVs and offers to share.
Import data:: Starts import of data from /sdcard/sleep-data/sleep-export.zip (local backup).
NOTE: If you already have existing sleep records in Sleep, import will not overwrite them. It will just import new records that are present in the import file.
Upload to Cloud:: Starts synchronization set in _Settings -> Services -> Cloud backup_ and uploads data from phone to cloud.
Download from Cloud:: Starts synchronization set in _Settings -> Services -> Cloud backup_ and downloads data from cloud to app.

== Guide

=== Local backup
[[local_backup]]
Backs up: *Sleep records, Settings, Noise recordings, Noise recordings metadata, Active alarms*
Does not back up: *Inactive alarms*

Your data are being backed up on a daily basis to `/sdcard/sleep-data/` folder on your phone. You can also start local backup manually using _Left_ ☰ _menu -> Backup -> Export data_.

What is backed up in this folder:
[horizontal]
/rec folder:: Contains all your recorded noise files.
noise.json:: Noise metadata
prefs.xml:: Settings
sleep-export.csv:: Latest sleep data
sleep-export.backup.csv:: Sleep data from the previous backup
ZIP file:: all the above (except /rec folder) are zipped up here for easy sharing

You can also open the CSV file on your computer (e.g. in Excel) for your own analysis of the sleep tracking data. The structure of the CSV file is <</devs/csv#,documented here>>.

The backup zip file can be used for migrating your Sleep settings and tracking history to a new phone - see <</faqs/new_phone_data_transfer#, our detailed guide>>.


=== Backup to SleepCloud (recommended)
[[sleepcloud_backup]]
Backs up: *Sleep records, Settings, Active alarms, Noise recordings metadata*
Does not back up: *Noise recordings, Inactive alarms*

Recommended backup service. It stores data in our own cloud designed for Sleep as Android. It has several unique features not present in other backup methods.

==== Prerequisites
- You need https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.addon.port[SleepCloud Backup add-on] installed on your phone.

- In order to use SleepCloud, you need to have a valid Google account and grant us a permission to use this account when connecting to the cloud.

==== Setting up
. Go to _Sleep -> Settings -> Privacy -> SleepCloud_ and connect _SleepCloud_.

==== Features
* Free SleepCloud service automatically initiates back up once a week.
* The paid PRO version automatically initiates backup when some relevant change happens (a new graph was added, an old graph was edited, etc.). You can force backup using _Left_ ≡ _menu -> Backup -> Upload to Cloud_

* You can view and modify your data online, by visiting https://sleep-cloud.appspot.com/SleepCloud.html[SleepCloud].
* Unlike other services, it does a full synchronization of records including deleting/updating of existing records. This makes it the most suitable service to synchronize data among multiple devices.
* It uses optimized communication protocols, so it consumes least data of all services.
* Synchronizes all of your settings (including active alarms), so if you get a new phone, just install SleepCloud backup and all your settings will be downloaded along with the records. It works in an inobtrusive way, so if you’ve changed any of the settings on the new phone already, they won’t get overwritten.

=== Backup to Dropbox or Google Drive
[[dropbox]][[google_drive]]
Backs up: *Sleep records, Settings, Noise recordings metadata, Alarms*
Does not back up: *Noise recordings*

To automatically backup your data to Dropbox or Google Drive:
. Install https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.addon.port[SleepCloud Backup add-on].
. Go to _Sleep -> Settings -> Services -> Cloud backup_ and connect either _Google Drive_ or _Dropbox_.

* Free SleepCloud service automatically initiates back up once a week.
* The paid PRO version automatically initiates backup when some relevant change happens (a new graph was added, an old graph was edited, etc.). You can force backup using _Left_ ≡ _menu -> Backup -> Upload to Cloud_.
* The back up service will create a *Sleep as Android* folder within the Google Drive storage, and *Sleep Cloud Backup* folder within the DropBox service.

=== Backup using Google provided backup cloud
[[google_backup]]
Backs up: *Sleep records, Settings, Alarms, Noise recordings metadata*
Does not back up: *Noise recordings*

Most Android phones support Google provided backup. This is an optional feature and it must be explicitly enabled by the user.

NOTE: We recommend using other methods, preferably <<sleepcloud_backup,SleepCloud>>, to backup your sleep records, as we have no direct control over initiation of Google backup so it may not work in all cases. This method is NOT meant to be used for synchronization of data or settings across phones.

. Enable Backup to Google One in  _System Settings -> System -> Backup_ (might be hidden under Advanced options) -> _Back up by Google One_ - the system will backup to a Google cloud automatically in background, or you can force immediate back up with "Back up now" button.

. In case you have developer tools available, you can force Google backup and restore to get reliable results. To force the backup, you can run “adb backup -f sleep-backup.bk com.urbandroid.sleep” when the old device is connected and to upload the backup to a new device run “adb restore sleep-backup.bk”.

=== Import data from email, Google Drive, Dropbox

If you tap on the CSV or ZIP file that was exported from Sleep (anywhere - in your email attachment, Drive, Dropbox, file manager), the system will offer to open it with Sleep as Android. This will import the included sleep records.
